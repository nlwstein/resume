<h3 id="skills">Main Technical Skills</h3>

<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt>Backend Software Development</dt>
<dd>My passion is developing the systems that the end user rarely interacts with directly, but absolutely must be in place (and function reliably enough) for them to have a satisfactory experience. Most of my experience has been with the C#, PHP, and JavaScript (Node, browser, and proprietary server-side scripting) languages. Of course, if the feature absolutely requires the use of AutoHotkey scripting, then you unfortunately have to use it, regardless of preference.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Database Design &amp; Integration</dt>
<dd>I have also used both SQL-based and non-SQL-based collection type databases, both in design of the database and in access through an application, utilizing ORMs, or some other sane data access layer. I have used MySQL / MariaDB, MongoDB, and HPE Vertica.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Project Management</dt>
<dd>From a project management standpoint, most of my experience has been with the Agile development methodology, using the Atlassian tools (BitBucket, JIRA, Confluence) with CD implemented through Bamboo, Jenkins or equivalent.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Unix Administration</dt>
<dd>While I am primarily interested and well-versed in implementing application-level functionality, I am comfortable on the command line. I like to use Node, Bash, or whatever is most appropriate to automate tedious tasks, such as creating multiple builds of one project with different configurations at the same time. I also have some experience with deployment management tools, like Ansible and Vagrant.</dd>
</dl></li>
